# TetrisJS
A Tetris clone in TypeScript (not JS! :) ). This is a straight port
of a Tetris game I wrote in Java AWT as a kid. I ported it to TS and
hope to make it more robust one day.

## Hacking
The game is built with `vite`. To test and build locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/bobbylight/TetrisJS.git
cd TetrisJS
npm install
npm run dev # Start dev server at loclahost:5173, hot deploy changes
npm run build # Production build into dist/
npm run preview # Test the production build at localhost:4173
```
